A production-style REST API for managing promotions, built with Python and Flask.

This service provides a robust and consistent API for CRUD operations and querying of promotion records. It emphasizes clear and explicit API design, moving away from ambiguous legacy concepts.

## Key Features

*   **Predictable API**: Easy to integrate with consistent behavior and clear filtering.
*   **Data Integrity**: Ensures valid data entry and reliable, atomic transactions.
*   **Flexible Management**: Safely deactivate promotions while preserving history.
*   **High Availability**: Designed for robust operation in cloud environments.

## Technology Stack

*   **Backend**: Python, Flask, Flask-SQLAlchemy
*   **Database**: PostgreSQL
*   **Containerization**: Docker
*   **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions, Tekton Pipelines (OpenShift)
*   **Testing**: PyTest, Behave, Codecov

## Quick Start

1.  **Open in VS Code DevContainer**:
    *   Open the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P or Cmd+Shift+P) and select "Dev Containers: Reopen in Container".
    *   This will build the development container and open the project inside it, with all necessary dependencies pre-installed.

2.  **Initialize the database**:
    ```bash
    # Create database tables
    flask db-create

    # Load sample data for testing(optional)
    flask load-data
    ```
    
3.  **Run the server**:
    ```bash
    flask run
    ```
    The service will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8080` by default.

4.  **Check syntax**:
    ```bash
    make lint
    ```

5.  **Run tests**:
    ```bash
    make test
    ```
6.  **Run BDD tests**:
    ```bash
    behave
    ```

## Kubernetes Deployment

Deploy to a local K3D/K3S cluster:

```bash
# Create K3S cluster with registry
make cluster

# Build Docker image
make build

# Push image to registry
make push

# Deploy to Kubernetes
make deploy
```

Verify deployment:
```bash
curl -H "Host: promotions.local" http://localhost:8080/health
```

For detailed instructions, see [Deployment Guide](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md).

## API & Swagger

- **Base path:** All REST endpoints are prefixed with `/api` (e.g., `/api/promotions`).
- **Swagger UI:** Available at `/apidocs/` when the service is running (e.g., http://localhost:8080/apidocs/).
- **Common examples:**
  ```bash
  # List promotions
  curl http://localhost:8080/api/promotions

  # Create a promotion
  curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/promotions \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"name":"Black Friday","promotion_type":"PERCENT","value":25,"product_id":123,"start_date":"2025-11-01","end_date":"2025-11-30"}'
  ```
